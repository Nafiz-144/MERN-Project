                Nikola Tesla's Visionary Flying Craft

                Nikola Tesla, the renowned inventor and electrical engineer, was
                known for his groundbreaking work in electromagnetism and
                wireless energy transmission. Among his many visionary ideas was
                a unique concept for a flying craft, which he often referred to
                as a "flying machine" or an "electro-propulsive" aircraft.
                Unlike conventional airplanes, Tesla's design was based on
                principles of electromagnetism, promising a revolutionary
                approach to air travel. Tesla's flying craft was designed to
                take off and land vertically (VTOL), eliminating the need for
                runways and allowing for more versatile operations in various
                environments. This feature alone set it apart from traditional
                aircraft, which require significant infrastructure for takeoff
                and landing. Tesla envisioned his machine being powered
                wirelessly, drawing energy from a network of ground-based
                transmitters. This idea was an extension of his broader vision
                for wireless energy transmission, where power could be supplied
                over long distances without the need for physical connections.

                The Zeeman effect (/ˈzeɪmən/; Dutch pronunciation: [ˈzeːmɑn]) is
                the effect of splitting of a spectral line into several
                components in the presence of a static magnetic field. It is
                named after the Dutch physicist Pieter Zeeman, who discovered it
                in 1896 and received a Nobel prize for this discovery. It is
                analogous to the Stark effect, the splitting of a spectral line
                into several components in the presence of an electric field.
                Also similar to the Stark effect, transitions between different
                components have, in general, different intensities, with some
                being entirely forbidden (in the dipole approximation), as
                governed by the selection rules. Since the distance between the
                Zeeman sub-levels is a function of magnetic field strength, this
                effect can be used to measure magnetic field strength, e.g. that
                of the Sun and other stars or in laboratory plasmas.

                In late 1886, Tesla met Alfred S. Brown, a Western Union
                superintendent, and New York attorney Charles Fletcher Peck.[64]
                The two men were experienced in setting up companies and
                promoting inventions and patents for financial gain.[65] Based
                on Tesla's new ideas for electrical equipment, including a
                thermo-magnetic motor idea,[66] they agreed to back the inventor
                financially and handle his patents. Together they formed the
                Tesla Electric Company in April 1887, with an agreement that
                profits from generated patents would go 1⁄3 to Tesla, 1⁄3 to
                Peck and Brown, and 1⁄3 to fund development.[65] They set up a
                laboratory for Tesla at 89 Liberty Street in Manhattan, where he
                worked on improving and developing new types of electric motors,
                generators, and other devices. In 1887, Tesla developed an
                induction motor that ran on alternating current (AC), a power
                system format that was rapidly expanding in Europe and the
                United States because of its advantages in long-distance,
                high-voltage transmission. The motor used polyphase current,
                which generated a rotating magnetic field to turn the motor (a
                principle that Tesla claimed to have conceived in
                1882).[67][68][69] This innovative electric motor, patented in
                May 1888, was a simple self-starting design that did not need a
                commutator, thus avoiding sparking and the high maintenance of
                constantly servicing and replacing mechanical brushes.[70][71]
                Along with getting the motor patented, Peck and Brown arranged
                to get the motor publicized, starting with independent testing
                to verify it was a functional improvement, followed by press
                releases sent to technical publications for articles to run
                concurrently with the issue of the patent.[72] Physicist William
                Arnold Anthony (who tested the motor) and Electrical World
                magazine editor Thomas Commerford Martin arranged for Tesla to
                demonstrate his AC motor on 16 May 1888 at the American
                Institute of Electrical Engineers.[72][73] Engineers working for
                the Westinghouse Electric & Manufacturing Company reported to
                George Westinghouse that Tesla had a viable AC motor and related
                power system—something Westinghouse needed for the alternating
                current system he was already marketing. Westinghouse looked
                into getting a patent on a similar commutator-less, rotating
                magnetic field-based induction motor developed in 1885 and
                presented in a paper in March 1888 by Italian physicist Galileo
                Ferraris, but decided that Tesla's patent would probably control
                the market.[74][75]

                (disambiguation). For other uses, see Time travel
                (disambiguation). The first page of The Time Machine published
                by Heinemann Time travel is the hypothetical activity of
                traveling into the past or future. Time travel is a widely
                recognized concept in philosophy and fiction, particularly
                science fiction. In fiction, time travel is typically achieved
                through the use of a hypothetical device known as a time
                machine. The idea of a time machine was popularized by H. G.
                Wells's 1895 novel The Time Machine.[1] It is uncertain whether
                time travel to the past would be physically possible. Such
                travel, if at all feasible, may give rise to questions of
                causality. Forward time travel, outside the usual sense of the
                perception of time, is an extensively observed phenomenon and is
                well understood within the framework of special relativity and
                general relativity. However, making one body advance or delay
                more than a few milliseconds compared to another body is not
                feasible with current technology. As for backward time travel,
                it is possible to find solutions in general relativity that
                allow for it, such as a rotating black hole. Traveling to an
                arbitrary point in spacetime has very limited support in
                theoretical physics, and is usually connected only with quantum
                mechanics or wormholes.
